# GPTHero

There have been a lot of [articles](https://gptzero.me/) and [papers](https://t.co/U0nz9pdMB8) recently around the concept of "watermarking" GPT outputs so that you can prove that the text is generated by LLMs over humans.

I don't believe this approach can work, there's too many ways around it - different words, changing sentence structure, increasing perplexity and "burstiness".

This repo is my attempt to prove it, here's what I have working so far:

- ~~Create an app that takes in text~~
- ~~Make it look pretty~~
- ~~Replace some words using synonyms~~
- Rewrite text with an LLM with a prompt that specifically targets perplexity and burstiness

## How to use

To run, just install the dependencies and run using these commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
